                        When working on a scavenger hunt for Operation Catapult, a summer camp I worked in the summer of
                        2024, I was tasked with creating a clue using a Raspberry Pi 4. To do so, I got another network
                        card for the Pi, and used RapsAP to host a remote access point with a password linked to the
                        clue. From there, I used nodogsplash to create a captive portal to display a simple website
                        giving a clue upon connection. The site was set to run 24/7, and I worked with campus network
                        security to have it secured.

                        For my Software Quality Assurance course, we worked to develop a digital version of
                        King of Tokyo. The focus was to take a test driven workflow, challenging us to find
                        the simplest way to implement features. Additionally, we followed the suggested
                        GitHub workflow where we experienced pull requests and a large focus on branching.
                        Overall, the project had a large focus on the types of testing where I developed
                        a lot of professional level skills.

                        The purpose of this project was to produce a full database for meal prepping. To do
                        so, we hosted the database with SQL Server and ran migrations to help us connect between
                        our own development databases and the actual production set. We connected them with a
                        user account linked the Sveltekit, where we built the frontend. We were able to populate
                        a clean database from scratch in seconds due to the use of migrations.

                        redesign for their organization. In doing so, we were able to consult them and worked
                        within the specifications they had and made adjustments based upon their feedback. As
                        part of this development, I was able to build an API for the project that took some
                        search terms in from the user, and would send back all of the valid results depending
                        on their filters selected. In addition, we worked with other APIs such as the Google Map
                        API for display as we learned the basics of web design.

                        Widely known as one of the harder projects to tackle at the university, my group
                        worked to recreate the RISC-V architecture from scratch. We implemented each part
                        of the CPU from scratch, and I had a major role in working to connect the components
                        together. In addition, we had to test it with the clock to run specific code. In
                        order to make this a bit easier for us, we also designed an assembler to keep our
                        code in assembly.

                        My first computer science project was inspired by the tank game showcased
                        in on Wii Sports. We worked with collisions and physics, and how to connect
                        them to graphics. My largest contribution had to do with drawing the tanks
                        at different angles depending on the geometry.
