            <h5>Minor: Artificial Intelligence</h5>
            Reflecting on my time so far at Rose, I am filled with lots of positive memories. I came in expecting to leave with an Engineering
            degree, and now I believe I'll also be leaving with so many skills and memories I never would have imagined. From developing people
            skills through my experience in Residence Life, the management skills learned through my Masters program, and the countless late-night
            conversations with people who have shaped who I am today Rose is unlike any other university. Each day I get a chance to wake up and learn
            more about the industry I will have a chance to impact one day, develop myself as a person more, and see some of the most impactful
            people I will ever meet. Through all of the fun, I still get the opportunity to learn from professors from different walks of life,
            all excited to teach me and my fellow students their craft. Walking through each step of the Software Design process while learning
            about the cutting edge of technology through my Artificial Intelligence classes is preparing me more than I could have ever expected.

                helping other people.

                    Resident Assistants at Rose are different. Here, we focus on truly forming a community on our floors. Through hosting countless
                    events, relentlessly checking on residents, and finding ways to add some extra fun into an engineering degree, it is one of the
                    most rewarding positions I have ever held. Through mentoring 2 Sophomore Advisors and 30 freshmen, I have watched myself grow
                    a lot.

                                Sophomore Advisors are fairly unique to Rose - it's a position similar to Resident Assistants expect they tend to
                                focus more on building community than having fun. Being able to plan events all around campus that have various
                                scopes really grew a lot of my management skills.

                        at Rose. There were multiple instances of plans falling through working with other people around campus or due to the
                        weather, giving me opportunities to learn how to bounce back and make things work.
